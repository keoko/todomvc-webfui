Port of [[http://todomvc.com/vanilla-examples/vanillajs/][TodoMVC VanillaJS]]  to [[https://github.com/drcode/webfui][iwebfui]].

** Prerequisites

You will need [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]] 2.0 or above installed.

** Running

To start the application, run:

    lein cljsbuild once

** TODO
- fix form-values watcher instead of creating a new watcher (i.e. input-text-watcher)
- how to set the focus?
- how to throw watch events?
- don't return always the whole state, only the updated part
- why it's calling 3 times render-all function after any change?
- checkbox not properly updated
